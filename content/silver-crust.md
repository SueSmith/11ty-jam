**Course 1: Amuse-Bouche** ‚Äì A bite-sized *Tuna Tartare* paired with a delicate *Lemon-Cilantro Foam*. The freshness of the tuna was elevated by the bright citrus foam, which added a lightness to the dish and set the tone for what was to come.

**Course 2: Carrot & Ginger Soup** ‚Äì Silky smooth and aromatic, this velvety soup was both comforting and refreshing. The subtle heat from the ginger was the perfect counterpoint to the natural sweetness of the carrot. A dollop of coconut cream and a sprinkle of toasted pumpkin seeds added depth and texture, turning a simple vegetable soup into something memorable.

The lobster was served with a small bed of microgreens and a hint of caviar, adding an extra layer of luxury to the dish.

**Course 4: Roasted Duck Breast with Fig Compote and Truffle Jus** ‚Äì This was one of the standout dishes. The duck was perfectly seared, with crispy skin and a succulent interior. The fig compote was a wonderful sweet contrast, while the truffle jus brought an earthy richness to the plate. Each bite was a harmonious blend of flavors that left me wanting more.

**Course 5: Black Truffle Risotto** ‚Äì The risotto was buttery and luxurious, with just the right level of creaminess. The black truffle was shaved generously over the top, infusing the dish with its heady, earthy aroma. Every spoonful was decadence on a plate, perfectly balanced and utterly satisfying.

**Course 6: Pre-Dessert Sorbet** ‚Äì A refreshing *Raspberry-Lime Sorbet*, perfectly tart and light. It cleansed the palate and prepared us for the final indulgence.

**Course 7: Chocolate & Gold Leaf Mousse** ‚Äì The grand finale.
